### cluster stack_1375  (stack, 1 members, 3 fields, size>=0x10)

Stack-frame local local_60 in lc3_mdct_fft (not shared across functions).

library hint: LIKELY LIBRARY (prefixes: lc3; 0/1 members are LIBRARY-class)

members (1 shown of 1):
  - lc3_mdct_fft @ 0x6b3c8  as local_60  [APPLICATION]

candidate layout (offsets/sizes are GROUND TRUTH from Ghidra — do not change them; name the struct + fields, refine types, judge cohesion):
```c
struct stack_1375 {
    uint32_t   field_0x0;   /* +0x0  sz=4 rw=r types=idx4 */
    uint32_t   field_0x4;   /* +0x4  sz=4 rw=r types=idx4 */
    uint8_t    _pad_0x8[0x4];   /* +0x8 pad */
    uint32_t   field_0xc;   /* +0xc  sz=4 rw=r types=idx4 */
};
```
