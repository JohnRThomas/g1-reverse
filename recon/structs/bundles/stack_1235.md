### cluster stack_1235  (stack, 1 members, 2 fields, size>=0x3)

Stack-frame local local_50 in gatt_parse_read_by_type_rsp (not shared across functions).

library hint: LIKELY LIBRARY (prefixes: gatt; 0/1 members are LIBRARY-class)

members (1 shown of 1):
  - gatt_parse_read_by_type_rsp @ 0x5bd18  as local_50  [APPLICATION]

candidate layout (offsets/sizes are GROUND TRUTH from Ghidra — do not change them; name the struct + fields, refine types, judge cohesion):
```c
struct stack_1235 {
    uint8_t    field_0x0;   /* +0x0  sz=1 rw=r types=idx1 */
    uint8_t    _pad_0x1[0x1];   /* +0x1 pad */
    uint8_t    field_0x2;   /* +0x2  sz=1 rw=r types=idx1 */
};
```
