### cluster param_0620  (param, 1 members, 2 fields, size>=0x8)

Shared pointer-parameter object unified across call-argument flow.

library hint: LIKELY LIBRARY (prefixes: -; 1/1 members are LIBRARY-class)

members (1 shown of 1):
  - gen_hash_m @ 0x8260c  as param_1  [LIBRARY]

candidate layout (offsets/sizes are GROUND TRUTH from Ghidra — do not change them; name the struct + fields, refine types, judge cohesion):
```c
struct param_0620 {
    uint32_t   field_0x0;   /* +0x0  sz=4 rw=r types=code */
    uint32_t   field_0x4;   /* +0x4  sz=4 rw=r types=idx4 */
};
```
